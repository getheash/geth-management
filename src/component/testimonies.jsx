                    We all know how important it is to keep major leaks off the internet. It protects your brand by maintaining the incentive to buy and prevents over-saturation. Geth saw me dealing with constant takedowns of my content. There would be days where I’d have to devote an extra 8 hours to finding and taking down content - 8 additional hours on top of planning, prepping, creating, editing, marketing, answering messages, school, personal life, etc.</i>

                    It was then that he offered his services to me to help take some of the load off my back. I hired Geth’s company to find leaks and submit DMCA takedowns and it’s a decision that I’m happy I made. Hiring Geth has allowed me to stress less, kept me away from having to read most ignorant comments, and it’s allowed me to invest more time into my work. He’s very on top of getting leaks submitted for DMCA Takedowns. He’s also been 100% professional and has never made me feel uncomfortable or judged. I’d highly recommend Geth’s services to any model who is in need of DMCA takedowns and really just wants to relieve a bit of the work related stress - <b>Rhonda</b></i> <a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyOneRhonda" target="_blank"><i style={{ color: "dodgerblue" }} className="fab fa-twitter"></i></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/onlyonerhonda/" target="_blank"><i style={{ color: "dodgerblue" }} className="fab fa-instagram"></i></a>

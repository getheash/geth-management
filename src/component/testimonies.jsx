                    We all know how important it is to keep major leaks off the internet. It protects your brand by maintaining the incentive to buy and prevents over-saturation. Geth saw me dealing with constant takedowns of my content. There would be days where I’d have to devote an extra 8 hours to finding and taking down content - 8 additional hours on top of planning, prepping, creating, editing, marketing, answering messages, school, personal life, etc.</i>

                    It was then that he offered his services to me to help take some of the load off my back. I hired Geth’s company to find leaks and submit DMCA takedowns and it’s a decision that I’m happy I made. Hiring Geth has allowed me to stress less, kept me away from having to read most ignorant comments, and it’s allowed me to invest more time into my work. He’s very on top of getting leaks submitted for DMCA Takedowns. He’s also been 100% professional and has never made me feel uncomfortable or judged. I’d highly recommend Geth’s services to any model who is in need of DMCA takedowns and really just wants to relieve a bit of the work related stress - <b>Rhonda</b></i> <a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyOneRhonda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><i style={{ color: "dodgerblue" }} className="fab fa-twitter"></i></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/onlyonerhonda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><i style={{ color: "dodgerblue" }} className="fab fa-instagram"></i></a>

                    Working with Geth is the best business decision I have ever made. When I started working with him I was very stressed out about how my content was being spread around the internet, it got to a point where I became discouraged and wanted to stop creating. Once I started working with him I immediately felt relief, he was very open with communication and on top of everything. When we started I sent him over a few things to flag that I'd been able to spot out and he responded that had already taken care of it. By hiring him I was able to get back in to my creative flow, I recommend him to everyone he is very easy going and professional. He is more than competent in his profession - <b>Persephanii</b></i> <a href="https://twitter.com/Persephaniii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><i style={{ color: "dodgerblue" }} className="fab fa-twitter"></i></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/persephanii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><i style={{ color: "dodgerblue" }} className="fab fa-instagram"></i></a></p>
